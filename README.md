# 100 Days Python Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for my 100 Days Python Challenge. Throughout this challenge, I'll be working on several real-life projects to enhance my Python skills.

## Motivation
The main goal of this challenge is to become proficient in Python programming by working on practical projects. I aim to improve my knowledge of Python, reinforce my understanding of software development, and enhance my problem-solving abilities.

## Project Structure
- Each project will have its own directory with a descriptive name.
- Inside each project directory, there will be separate directories for source code, documentation, and any additional resources.

## Progress Tracking
I will maintain a daily log or journal to track my progress, challenges faced, and key learnings for each day of the challenge.
