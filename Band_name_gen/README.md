# Shecktar Band Name Generator

## Description
The Shecktar Band Name Generator is a simple Python program that prompts users to input the city they grew up in and the name of their pet, and then suggests a potential band name based on this input. The generator then combines the city name and the pet name, separated by a hyphen, to propose a unique band name.

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script.
2. Run the Python script in your local environment.
3. Follow the prompts to input the city you grew up in and the name of your pet.
4. The suggested band name will be displayed based on your input.
